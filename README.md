# Play Billing For Unity

This is an Andriod Native plugin written in Kotlin for the Unity game engine. The plugin lets you use Google Play Billing v6.0.1 in Unity.

This was made as an experiment to see if ChatGPT/GPT-4 is able to create full-fledged plugins/apps/etc. This is my first experiance with Kotlin programming and writing Android Native plugins for Unity. Most of the code in this project was generated by ChatGPT and GPT-4 with plugins.

The plugin has not been tested much, so I would not recommend using this, without extensive testing, for production. The limited testing took place in Unity 2021.3.27f1 and 2022.3.4f1.

## Update!

I have, with the help of GPT-4, basically fully revamped the code to support most, if not all of the features of Google Play Billing Library v6.0.1. I have tested all functionality, but not in a production app.
