# Play Billing For Unity

This is a simple Andriod Native plugin written in Kotlin for the Unity game engine. The plugin lets you use Google Play Billing v6.0.1 in Unity.

This was made as an experiment to see if ChatGPT or GPT-4 is able to create full-fledged plugins/apps/etc. This is my first experiance with Kotlin programming and writing Android Native plugins for Unity. Most of the code in this project was generated by ChatGPT and GPT-4 with plugins.

The plugin has not been tested much, so I would not recommend using this, without extensive testing, for production. The limited testing took place in Unity 2021.3.27f1. Please do not expect this to be developed much further in the near future.
